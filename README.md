# Using AI in motorway toll booths to apply appropriate rates based on vehicle type recognition.

## Dissertation project degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Liverpool Hope University

This dissertation research will focus on vehicle type classification in the images into the four most
common vehicle classes which are, Truck, Bus, Car and Motorcycle in a motorway toll booth
environment. The idea is to automate the process of charging drivers when going through the
highway or any type of road where the charge is applied. The system should be able to detect the
vehicle type based on the image provided and then eventually apply an appropriate charge.

The project includes:
* Analysing and comparing two datasets, choosing the better one for further research
* Comparing many classification models including transfer learning 
* Picking the best dataset for the problem of the research
* Analysing results of the models and comparing their fine-tuning, layers and overall structure.
